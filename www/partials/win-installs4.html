        Windows, like OSX, does not have a built in package manager (a fancy term for a piece of software that lets you easily install other software that you need as a developer). There will be times, many weeks into class, as you gain confidence and skill, that you will want to use a package manager. Therefore, if you feel up to the task - meaning, you were able to install all the required software easily - you may want to install Chocolately.

        Here's the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">official page</a>, but it's instructions are written to an audience of existing software developers and may be confusing for a layperson. Here's the basic instructions:<br><br>

        1. Press your Windows key.<br><br>
        2. Type cmd into the search box.<br><br>
        3. You'll see a black box as the first search result named cmd.<br><br>
        4. Right click that icon and select the "Run as administrator" option. This opens up the <i><b>Windows Command Line.</b></i><br><br>
        5. When that starts, copy the following command with Ctrl+C, and once that's done paste it into the command line by right-clicking anywhere in that window. @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
